# CargoHub Warehouse API 

CargoHub is a second-year group project developed during my study Computer Science. We as a team were given an excisting Python codebase and were tasked with analyzing its flaws in terms of code quality, structure and
security. Based on our findings and results, we completely refactored the code into a more clean and maintanable API using C# and frameworks such as ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. After refactoring we also had to 
ensure its reliability, so we also implemented integration and unit tests to validate the new functionality.

I contributed by helping redesign the API structure, setting up EF Core Models, creating endpoints, securing sensitive data and improving code readability. Because of this project, I learned a lot about backend development,
clean code principles and team collaboration using Git and Github. 

Below is a basic sequence diagram that illustrates the flow of a typical request through the CargoHub API, from user input to database interaction and response.
